# Decode-World

Hey,

Im an Audio Engineer trying to decode the situation that made me and my fellow entertainers become literally prohibited to do my job. So I decided to learn code so I can prepare my self for the next crisis that will threaten my livelihood and be ready for the worst. Thats why Im aiming to become even more independent and make my mission to become reliant only on my mac and the knowledge I have make me capable of thriving even in the worst kind of crisis. Theres my 50cent. Or better yet 1 euro, that you will donate on my patreon when I will make an account there ;) :P I will make sound, light, video and coding smoothie to make something new and great to enjoy - smart Iot for your entertainment. Now get ready for ideas that will spark ur imagination and between the lines there will be just the kind of messages u were searching for ;) Stay Tuned - Im on a mission to change the world :)
